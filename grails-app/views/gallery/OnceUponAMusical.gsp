    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">A really eclectic
    compilation of songs from diverse musicals made up the programme for this
    well-presented show. And the numbers chosen were not necessarily the major
    hits from the shows, but nevertheless, easily recognised.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Director Matt Beavis
    achieved a slick production, with music interspersed with some wonderfully
    brief comic sketches which gained their laughs and were gone. The most
    audacious but to my mind the funniest was the discussion between Margaret
    Catton as Grandmother and Anna Chidgey as Granddaughter, over the demise of
    Grandfather, due to making love to the rhythm of church bells on a Sunday
    morning. It has a great punch line. Trickled through the show these laughter
    breaks gave the show a light touch and also valuable time for others in the
    cast to change into one of the many beautiful costumes for which WODS are
    justifiable renown.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Barbara Windsor,
    Yvonne Mound and Jane Martin amassed these, colour-themed as usual, but
    their sea-greens for the underwater scene were just lovely.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Quick knock-knock-type
    jokes added more comedy and there was a clever school sketch too.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">WODS build out an
    apron from the stage for these productions which offers space for more
    movement and opportunities for some more intimate dialogues.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">The show was pinned
    together by Will Harris – master of the understated who, in curmudgeonly
    mood berated the chosen numbers as being not to his taste but was slowly
    brought round as the show progressed.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Choreography played a
    strong role in the production, with a group of young dancers supplemented by
    older ones, performing the creations of Vivienne Vassay.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Three small dancers brought grace to With A Smile And A Song
    and everyone who could hoof it joined in the tap for Zippidee Doo Dah and
    made a splendid sound.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Many of the numbers
    had a soloist with the company joining in. The Second Star To The Right from
    Anna Chidgey was sung with tenderness, Be Our Guest from Ricky Thompsett was
    sincere and developed into a fun number with the company dressed as maids,
    cooks, butlers, waiters etc as we, the audience, were invited to our fish
    and chip supper.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Part Of Your World was
    an emotional plea from<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>mermaid
    Jacky Davis to have feet and experience walking down the street and Helen
    Teasdale and Joe Goodall got the voices, actions and harmonies just right
    with Doll On A Music Box and Truly Scrumptious.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">The snake song from
    Jungle Book – Trust In Me – was given another meaning altogether by the
    seductive and richly-voiced Jane Martin and Dorothy and her Scarecrow, Tin
    Man and Lion reminded us what they needed from The Wizard Of Oz.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">A well rehearsed happy
    show of perfect length – and supper too – an excellent evening.<o:p>

    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">What a really
    thoughtfully put together show this was. The title leads once to suspect it
    might be the well known numbers from popular musicals which compile the
    programme but no, here we had the expected alongside the unexpected, all
    glued competently together by the slightly grouchy Will Harris who was won
    over to the joy of music from the musicals, in the end.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">The comedy was short,
    pithy and very funny. I enjoyed the short interludes from Laurie and Yvonne
    and the quick-fire rounds of ‘knock-knock’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>or ‘ello ello’type jokes which were there, laughed at and gone,
    to be followed swiftly by the next one. It was To The Sound of Church Bells,
    presented with such straight faces by Margaret and Anna which really
    tickled, and I shall think of ice-cream vans in an entirely different light
    in future, - whatever tune they constantly ring out!<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">WODS is fortunate in
    its range of ages and the talent of all. Concerted numbers sound all of a
    piece and then out steps a soloist from that crowd with a really good voice.
    Director Matt Beavis and MD Brian D Steel had obviously spent a good deal of
    time working out who was going to sing what as the chosen numbers were very
    well suited to each voice. In particular Jacky Davis (where did she find the
    time to do this, and star in Croydon Stagers’ Half a Sixpence?) and the
    wonderfully throaty voice of Trust In Me which Jane turned into such a sexy
    number that I completely forgot it was originally a snake’s song – or
    perhaps the two were more closely related after all?<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">Costumes for this show
    were well up to WOD’s own high standards. I particularly applaud the
    underwater scene – for its inventive costumes, its beautiful colouring and
    lighting and its collection of numbers. Other costume drama was achieved by
    those wonderful witches with their impressively large pointed hats and
    dresses in such an abundance of colours – and all matching too. </font> <o:p>
    </o:p>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">The quartet following
    the Yellow Brick Road had certainly had some care lavished on their costumes
    – I thought the Tin Man particularly splendid.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">Vivienne Vassay’s
    dance numbers blended in well with a highlight being the tap number to
    Zippidee Doo Dah bringing in anyone in the cast who could do as little as a
    shuffle ball change!<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">The school scene with
    teacher Helen’s patience being tried at every turn was slick and fun and I
    loved that outrageously rebellious wig with its punk overtones.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">Highlights from the
    show, for me, were Ricky’s Hush-A-Bye Mountain, Helen and Joe’s Doll On
    A Music Box and Truly Scrumptious, Celena and Joe’s Something Good, Anna
    and Shane’s Sixteen Going On Seventeen, the whole concept, execution and
    timing of Be Our Guest, so cleverly inviting us, the audience, to tuck in to
    our welcome fish and chips and the very well executed Consider Yourself from
    Stephen, Katie, Samantha and Sophie.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">Having taken eons to
    get the tune of It’s A Small World out of my head where it seemed to take
    up residence, you have very kindly re-introduced it. I am hoping it will
    depart again soon!<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><font color="#808080">Well done WODS for
    presenting a most enjoyable evening which was an excellent length, slick,
    entertaining and serving as a good reminder of all the songs from the
    musicals we have heard but which have not remained at the forefront of
    productions such as this. It was good to hear them again.<o:p>
    </o:p>

    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#808080"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Thank you for inviting
    me, once again, and for my delicious supper for which you sang!<o:p>
